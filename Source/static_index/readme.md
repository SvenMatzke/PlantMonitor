#Start Dev
start mock_monitor/mock_server.py. This is a little flask webserver 
rebuilding the responses for development of the react frontend.

# setup your environment
```
npm install
```

# start react dev server 
```
npm run-script start
```

# build deployable static files 
```
npm run-script build
```
The result can be found in dist and should be used for assembly.
